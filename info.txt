How to Protect Yourself.
Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home.
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person in respiratory droplets from someone who is infected.
People who are infected often have symptoms of illness.
Some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads and the severity of illness it causes..
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person..
Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus..
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
Also, routinely clean frequently touched surfaces..
How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.
Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.
Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.
Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggest that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious..

CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission..
CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure..
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance..
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.
Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Yes.
They should be routinely washed depending on the frequency of use..
A washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering..
Individuals should be careful not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth when removing their face covering and wash hands immediately after removing..
1.
Cut out two 10-by-6-inch rectangles of cotton fabric.
Use tightly woven cotton, such as quilting fabric or cotton sheets.
T-shirt fabric will work in a pinch.
Stack the two rectangles; you will sew the mask as if it was a single piece of fabric..
2.
Fold over the long sides ¼ inch and hem.
Then fold the double layer of fabric over ½ inch along the short sides and stitch down..
3.
Run a 6-inch length of 1/8-inch wide elastic through the wider hem on each side of the mask.
These will be the ear loops.
Use a large needle or a bobby pin to thread it through.
Tie the ends tight.
Dont have elastic?
Use hair ties or elastic head bands.
If you only have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the mask behind your head..
4.
Gently pull on the elastic so that the knots are tucked inside the hem.
Gather the sides of the mask on the elastic and adjust so the mask fits your face.
Then securely stitch the elastic in place to keep it from slipping..
Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19.
CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States.
We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (asymptomatic) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.
This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.
In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission..
It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure..
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.
Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
This recommendation complements and does not replace the Presidents Coronavirus Guidelines for America, 30 Days to Slow the Spreadexternal icon, which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
CDC will make additional recommendations as the evidence regarding appropriate public health measures continues to develop..
This document is intended to address frequently asked questions about cloth face coverings..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms..
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people are in a community setting, especially in situations where you may be near people.
These settings include grocery stores and pharmacies.
These face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing.
Cloth face coverings are especially important to wear in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness..
Yes.
Wearing cloth face coverings is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people (social distancing), frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
View CDCs guidance on how to protect yourself..
Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost..
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children younger than 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance..
Surgical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance..

Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect..
High touch surfaces include:
Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc..
For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes.
Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturers instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely..

Interim Recommendations for U.S.
Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Revisions were made on 3/26/2020 to reflect the following:.
There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet).
This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets.
On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented.
Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites.
Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.
Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings..
It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious.
Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate air changes per hour and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection.
Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air..
This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation.
It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments.
These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available..
These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public..
Keep Your Distance to Slow the Spread.
Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)..
Social distancing, also called physical distancing, means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.
To practice social or physical distancing:.
In addition to everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world..
When COVID-19 is spreading in your area, everyone should limit close contact with individuals outside your household in indoor and outdoor spaces.
Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others when possible, even if you have no symptoms.
Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick..
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period.
Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.
The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs.
Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes.
However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sun light and humidity.
Social distancing helps limit contact with infected people and contaminated surfaces..
Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19.
Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community..
Stay connected while staying away.
It is very important to stay in touch with friends and family that dont live in your home.
Call, video chat, or stay connected using social media.
Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations and having to socially distance yourself from someone you love can be difficult.
Read tips for stress and coping..
Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others.
Someone in self-quarantine stays separated from others, and they limit movement outside of their home or current place.
A person may have been exposed to the virus without knowing it (for example, when traveling or out in the community), or they could have the virus without feeling symptoms.
Quarantine helps limit further spread of COVID-19..
Isolation is used to separate sick people from healthy people.
People who are in isolation should stay home.
In the home, anyone sick should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific sick bedroom or space and using a different bathroom (if possible)..
If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, read about symptoms..
If you or someone in your home might have been exposed.

It is important to remember that people – including those of Asian descent – who do not live in or have not recently been in an area of ongoing spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, or have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans..
Public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are stressful times for people and communities.
Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma(1) toward people, places, or things.
For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease.
Stigma can also occur after a person has been released from COVID-19 quarantine even though they are not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others..
Some groups of people who may be experiencing stigma because of COVID-19 include:.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger towards other people..
Stigmatized groups may be subjected to:.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health(2) of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient(3)..
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..

The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible.
While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households.
If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household..
To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends..
Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
This is especially important if you have been in a public place..
Revise spring break and travel plans if they included non-essential travel..
If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk.
Children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms, but they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19..
Children 2 years and older should wear a cloth face covering their nose and mouth when in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Messages for parents, school staff, and others working with children.
As public conversations around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19.
Parents, family members, school staff, and other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear.
CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease..
Make yourself available to listen and to talk..
Avoid language that might blame others and lead to stigma..
Pay attention to what children see or hear on television, radio, or online..
Provide information that is honest and accurate..
Teach children everyday actions to reduce the spread of germs..
Try to keep information simple and remind them that health and school officials are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy..

Protect Yourself and Others from COVID-19.
Staying physically active is one of the best ways to keep your mind and body healthy.
In many areas, people can visit parks, trails, and open spaces as a way to relieve stress, get some fresh air and vitamin D, stay active, and safely connect with others..
Know Before You Go: While these facilities and areas can offer health benefits, it is important that you follow the steps below to protect yourself and others from COVID-19..
check icon Visit parks that are close to your home.
check icon Prepare before you visit.
check icon Stay at least 6 feet away from others (social distancing) and take other steps to prevent COVID-19.
check icon Play it safe around and in swimming pools.
Keep space between yourself and others.
times icon Visit parks if you are sick or were recently exposed to COVID-19.
times icon Visit crowded parks.
times icon Use playgrounds.
times icon Use hot tubs, spas, water playgrounds, or water parks.
times icon Participate in organized activities or sports..
Traveling long distances to visit a park may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 as:.
State and local authorities will decide whether parks and other recreational facilities will open.
Check with the park in advance to be sure you know which areas or services are open, such as bathroom facilities and concessions, and bring what you need with you..
The National Park Serviceexternal iconexternal icon will decide on a park-by-park basis whether a national park will be open.
Please check with individual parksexternal iconexternal icon for specific details since, in many cases, visitor centers, concessions, and bathroom facilities might be closed..
State and local authorities will decide whether natural bodies of water and beaches or swim areas will be open.
Please check with individual beaches or swim areas for specific details..
If a park, beach, or recreational facility is open for public use, visiting is okay as long as you practice social distancing and everyday steps such as washing hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.
Follow these actions when visiting a park, beach, or recreational facility:.
Do not use playgrounds, including water playgrounds, located within local, state, or national parks..
Using playgrounds might lead to the spread of COVID-19 because:.
In general, most organized activities and sports such as basketball, baseball, soccer, and football that are held on park fields, open areas, and courts are not recommended.
These activities and sports typically require coaches and athletes who are not from the same household or living unit to be in close proximity, which increases their potential for exposure to COVID-19..
There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the water.
Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (with chlorine or bromine) of pools should kill COVID-19..
Swimming and other water-related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity needed for a healthy life.
If you are not sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it is safe to use swimming pools as long as steps are taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19:.
Swimming does carry some health risks.
Visit CDCs Healthy Swimming website for information to help you prevent illness and drowning, while having fun and enjoying the health benefits of swimming..
While proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (with chlorine or bromine) should kill COVID-19 in hot tubs, spas, water playgrounds, and water parks, you should not use these facilities within local, state, or national parks at this time because:.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.
Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats.
Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans..
Some coronaviruses that infect animals can sometimes be spread to humans and then spread between people, but this is rare.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people.
This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19.
However, we do not know the exact source of this virus.
Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19.
The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person.
The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS..
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking.
Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low..
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reportedexternal icon to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Only a few of the animals reported to be positive showed signs of illness..
The first caseexternal icon in the United States of an animal testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
Samples from this tiger were collected and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed signs of respiratory illness.
Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
This investigation is ongoing..
We are still learning about this virus, but we know that it originally came from an animal source and is primarily spreading from person-to-person, but  it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations..
CDC is working with human and animal health partners to monitor this situation and will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19..
Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection..
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pets health..
If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people.
Until we know more about this virus, people sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals..
If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick..
In the United States, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low..
However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals..

Moderate-to-severe asthma may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness..
Chronic lung disease.
Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
Based on data from other viral respiratory infections, COVID-19 might cause flare-ups of chronic lung diseases leading to severe illness..
Diabetes, including type 1, type 2, or gestational, may put people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk
People with diabetes whose blood sugar levels are often higher than their target are more likely to have diabetes-related health problems.
Those health problems can make it harder to overcome COVID-19..
Serious heart conditions.
Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
COVID-19, like other viral illnesses such as the flu, can damage the respiratory system and make it harder for your heart to work.
For people with heart failure and other serious heart conditions this can lead to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms..
Chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis.
Chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis may increase a persons risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
Dialysis patients are more prone to infection and severe illness because of weakened immune systems; treatments and procedures to manage kidney failure; and coexisting conditions such as diabetes..
Severe obesity.
Severe obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, puts people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
Severe obesity increases the risk of a serious breathing problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major complication of COVID-19 and can cause difficulties with a doctors ability to provide respiratory support for seriously ill patients.
People living with severe obesity can have multiple serious chronic diseases and underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19..
People aged 65 years and older.
Older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
Although COVID-19 can affect any group, the older you are, the higher your risk of serious disease.
Eight out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years or older; risk of death is highest among those 85 years or older.
The immune systems of older adults weaken with age, making it harder to fight off infections.
Also, older adults commonly have chronic diseases that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19..
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility .
Many cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have occurred among older adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.
Why you might be at higher risk.
The communal nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, and the population served (generally older adults often with underlying medical conditions), put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness from COVID-19..
Many conditions and treatments can cause a person to have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised), including cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell count or not on HIV treatment, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications..
Why you might be at higher risk.
People with a weakened immune system have reduced ability to fight infectious diseases, including viruses like COVID-19.
Knowledge is limited about the virus that causes COVID-19, but based on similar viruses, there is concern that immunocompromised patients may remain infectious for longer than other COVID-19 patients..
Liver disease.
Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, may increase risk for serious illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
Severe illness caused by COVID-19 and the medications used to treat some severe consequences of COVID-19 can cause strain on the liver, particularly for those with underlying liver problems.
People living with serious liver disease can have a weakened immune system, leaving the body less able to fight COVID-19..
Moderate-to-severe asthma may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Why you might be at higher risk.
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness..

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States..
Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.
All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious underlying chronic medical conditions like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system.
Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness.
You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider..
If you or someone you care for are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting sick.
In addition to practicing everyday preventive actions, people with disabilities who have direct support providers can help protect themselves from respiratory illness in the following ways:.
There are some additional things people with disabilities can do to prepare during the COVID-19 outbreak:.
There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.
There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms..
People who are homeless are at risk of COVID-19..
Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection.
Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at higher risk for severe disease..
Health departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group.
If possible, identifying non-congregate settings where those at highest risk can stay may help protect them from COVID-19..
Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID-19 may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do.
Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should:.
Any person experiencing homelessness with symptoms consistent with COVID-19  (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers).
These staff will help the individual understand how to isolate themselves and identify options for medical care as needed..
If they meet criteria for testing, people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing through a healthcare provider..
Local public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics..
Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can best be isolated from other people to prevent spreading the infection.
Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems, and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they meet the criteria to end isolation..
Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people.
If no other options are available, homeless service providers should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support..
Homeless service providers can accept donations of food and clothing during community spread of COVID-19, but general infection control precautions should be taken.
Request that donors not donate if they are sick..
Homeless shelters can screen clients for symptoms of respiratory infections..
Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19.
Make sure they have a separate place they can safely stay within the shelter or at an alternate site in coordination with local health authorities.
An on-site nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments..
Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer clients that the client might have COVID-19..
Homeless shelters serve a critical function in our communities.
Shelters should stay open unless homeless service providers, health departments, and housing authorities have determined together that a shelter needs to close..
Connecting people to stable housing should continue to be a priority..
We do not currently know if pregnant people have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result.
Based on available information, pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant..

The effects of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups is still emerging; however, current data suggest a disproportionate burden of illness and death among racial and ethnic minority groups.
A recent CDC MMWR report included race and ethnicity data from 580 patients hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19 found that 45% of individuals for whom race or ethnicity data was available were white, compared to 55% of individuals in the surrounding community.
However, 33% of hospitalized patients were black compared to 18% in the community and 8% were Hispanic, compared to 14% in the community.
These data suggest an overrepresentation of blacks among hospitalized patients.
Among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, New York Citypdf iconexternal icon identified death rates among Black/African American persons (92.3 deaths per 100,000 population) and Hispanic/Latino persons (74.3) that were substantially higher than that of white (45.2) or Asian (34.5) persons.
Studies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities..

These conditions, over time, lead to different levels of health risks, needs, and outcomes among some people in certain racial and ethnic minority groups..
Health differences between racial and ethnic groups are often due to economic and social conditions that are more common among some racial and ethnic minorities than whites.
In public health emergencies, these conditions can also isolate people from the resources they need to prepare for and respond to outbreaks.1,13, 14.
For many people in racial and ethnic minority groups, living conditions may contribute to underlying health conditions and make it difficult to follow steps to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or to seek treatment if they do get sick..
The types of work and policies in the work environments where people in some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk for getting sick with COVID-19.
Examples include:.
Existing health disparities, such as poorer underlying health and barriers to getting health care, might make members of many racial and ethnic minority groups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of COVID-19..
History shows that severe illness and death rates tend to be higher for racial and ethnic minority groups during public health emergencies.12 Addressing the needs of vulnerable populations in emergencies includes improving day-to-day life and harnessing the strengths of these groups.
Shared faith, family, and cultural institutions are common sources of social support.
These institutions can empower and encourage individuals and communities to take actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who become sick, and help community members cope with stress.
For example, families, churches and other groups in affected populations can help their communities face an epidemic by consulting CDC guidance documents for their organization type..
Stay home and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness or if you may have issues getting assistance if you get sick..
If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease..
Related: How to Protect Yourself.
Older people and people of any age who have serious underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
People who may have issues getting assistance if they become ill, like those experiencing homelessness or people with disabilities are also at increased risk from COVID-19..
These conditions and situations may result in increased stress during this pandemic.
Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions..
Things you can do to support yourself:.
Related: Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home.
Depending on how severe the outbreak is, your local public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce peoples risk of being exposed to COVID-19.
These actions can slow the spread and reduce the impact of disease..
Stay home as much as possible.
Take extra measures to put distance between yourself and other people to further reduce your risk of being exposed to this new virus..

Community preparedness planning for COVID-19 should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration.
Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their health and independence..
Long-term care facilities should be vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19.

A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..

Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:.
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak..
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19..
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities..
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..

These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities..
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19..
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:.
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:.
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak..
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19..
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19..
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..

CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19..
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..

In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities..
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19..
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities..
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..

Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak..
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19..
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..

Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak..
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.

At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..

Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:.
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak..
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19..
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities..
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online..
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website..
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes..
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold..
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis..
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV..
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases..
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals..
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths..
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem..
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community..
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ..
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners..
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late..
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown..
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)..
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses..
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts..
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons..
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient..
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19..
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others..
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period..
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging..
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19..
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed..
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing..
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected..
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection..
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website..
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19..
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online..
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail..
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time..

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness..
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy..

No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children..
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance..
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance..
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19..
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed..
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork..
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community..
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location..
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19..
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19..
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed..
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness..
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs...
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past..
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:.
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others..
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child..

Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:.
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:.
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:.
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you..
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives..
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol..
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection..
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19..
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available..
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019..
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:.
Put your household plan into action..
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall..
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak..
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community..
Please contact your local health department to find out more..
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks..
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible..
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html..
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html..
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances..
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms..
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19..
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information..
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected..
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness..
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples..
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon..
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis..
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon..
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus..
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April..
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions..
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab..
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others..
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19..
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:.
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:.
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:.
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19..
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed..
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19..
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider..
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned..
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:.
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition..
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed..

There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19..
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death..
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads..
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator)..
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag..
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled..
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases..
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance..
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office..
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease..
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:.
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information..
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19..
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak..
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended..
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets..
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them..
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering..
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus..
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19..
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19..
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking..
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets..
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets..
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care..
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed..
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19..
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States..
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies..
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country..
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available..
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus..
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance..
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:.
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19..
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2Close contact is defined as—.
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g being coughed on).
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met.
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus..
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings..
