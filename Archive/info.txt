A guide to help you make decisions and seek appropriate medical care
There are laboratory tests that can identify the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC, whereas medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
Here is some information that might help you make decisions about seeking medical care or testing.
CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.
COVID-19 testing differs by location.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your medical provider first.
You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health departments website to look for the latest local information on testing.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.
Community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in parts of the United States.
In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus.
You should continue to practice all the protective measures recommended to keep yourself and others from getting infected.

How to Protect Yourself
Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person in respiratory droplets from someone who is infected.
People who are infected often have symptoms of illness.
Some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads and the severity of illness it causes.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
Also, routinely clean frequently touched surfaces.
How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.
Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.
Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.
Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggest that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.

CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.
Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Yes.
They should be routinely washed depending on the frequency of use.
A washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.
Individuals should be careful not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth when removing their face covering and wash hands immediately after removing.
1.
Cut out two 10-by-6-inch rectangles of cotton fabric.
Use tightly woven cotton, such as quilting fabric or cotton sheets.
T-shirt fabric will work in a pinch.
Stack the two rectangles; you will sew the mask as if it was a single piece of fabric.
2.
Fold over the long sides ¼ inch and hem.
Then fold the double layer of fabric over ½ inch along the short sides and stitch down.
3.
Run a 6-inch length of 1/8-inch wide elastic through the wider hem on each side of the mask.
These will be the ear loops.
Use a large needle or a bobby pin to thread it through.
Tie the ends tight.
Dont have elastic?
Use hair ties or elastic head bands.
If you only have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the mask behind your head.
4.
Gently pull on the elastic so that the knots are tucked inside the hem.
Gather the sides of the mask on the elastic and adjust so the mask fits your face.
Then securely stitch the elastic in place to keep it from slipping.
Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19
CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States.
We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (asymptomatic) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.
This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.
In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.
It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.
CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.
Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
This recommendation complements and does not replace the Presidents Coronavirus Guidelines for America, 30 Days to Slow the Spreadexternal icon, which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
CDC will make additional recommendations as the evidence regarding appropriate public health measures continues to develop.
This document is intended to address frequently asked questions about cloth face coverings.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people are in a community setting, especially in situations where you may be near people.
These settings include grocery stores and pharmacies.
These face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing.
Cloth face coverings are especially important to wear in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness.
Yes.
Wearing cloth face coverings is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people (social distancing), frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
View CDCs guidance on how to protect yourself.
Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost.
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children younger than 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.
Surgical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance.

Interim Recommendations for U.S.
Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Revisions were made on 3/26/2020 to reflect the following:
There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet).
This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets.
On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented.
Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites.
Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.
Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.
It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious.
Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate air changes per hour and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection.
Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air.
This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation.
It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments.
These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.
These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public.
Keep Your Distance to Slow the Spread
Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Social distancing, also called physical distancing, means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.
To practice social or physical distancing:
In addition to everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world.
When COVID-19 is spreading in your area, everyone should limit close contact with individuals outside your household in indoor and outdoor spaces.
Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others when possible, even if you have no symptoms.
Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period.
Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.
The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs.
Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes.
However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sun light and humidity.
Social distancing helps limit contact with infected people and contaminated surfaces.
Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19.
Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community.
Stay connected while staying away.
It is very important to stay in touch with friends and family that dont live in your home.
Call, video chat, or stay connected using social media.
Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations and having to socially distance yourself from someone you love can be difficult.
Read tips for stress and coping.
Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others.
Someone in self-quarantine stays separated from others, and they limit movement outside of their home or current place.
A person may have been exposed to the virus without knowing it (for example, when traveling or out in the community), or they could have the virus without feeling symptoms.
Quarantine helps limit further spread of COVID-19.
Isolation is used to separate sick people from healthy people.
People who are in isolation should stay home.
In the home, anyone sick should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific sick bedroom or space and using a different bathroom (if possible).
If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, read about symptoms.
If you or someone in your home might have been exposed
Be alert for symptoms.
Watch for fever,* cough, or shortness of breath.
As a family, you can plan and make decisions now that will protect you and your family during a COVID-19 outbreak.

This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this interim guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available.
Printer-friendly version:  pdf icon125 KB, 5 pages
This interim guidance is to help household members plan for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages household members to prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community.
COVID-19 is caused by a new virus.
There is much to learn about its transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease.
We want to help everyone prepare to respond to this public health threat.
A COVID-19 outbreak could last for a long time in your community.
Depending on the severity of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend community actions designed to help keep people healthy, reduce exposures to COVID-19, and slow the spread of the disease.
Local public health officials may make recommendations appropriate to your local situation.
Creating a household plan can help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.
You should base the details of your household plan on the needs and daily routine of your household members.
Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan.
Meet with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community and what the needs of each person will be.
Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications.
There is limited information about who may be at risk for severe complications from COVID-19 illness.
From the data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and from data for related coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is possible that older adults and persons who have underlying chronic medical conditions may be at risk for more serious complications.
Early data suggest older people are more likely to have serious COVID-19 illness.
If you or your household members are at increased risk for COVID-19 complications, please consult with your health care provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
CDC will recommend actions to help keep people at high risk for complications healthy if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community.
Get to know your neighbors.
Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning.
If your neighborhood has a website or social media page, consider joining it to maintain access to neighbors, information, and resources.
Identify aid organizations in your community.
Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, health care services, support, and resources.
Consider including organizations that provide mental health or counseling services, food, and other supplies.
Create an emergency contact list.
Ensure your household has a current list of emergency contacts for family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.
Practice everyday preventive actions now.
Remind everyone in your household of the importance of practicing everyday preventive actions that can help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses:
Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy.
Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible.
Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.
Learn how to care for someone with COVID-19 at home.
Learn about the emergency operations plan at your childs school or childcare facility.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, local public health officials may recommend temporary school dismissals to help slow the spread of illness.
School authorities also may decide to dismiss a school if too many students or staff are absent.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Learn about your employers emergency operations plan.
Discuss sick-leave policies and telework options for workers who are sick or who need to stay home to care for sick household members.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation.
Get up-to-date information about local COVID-19 activity from public health officialsexternal icon.
Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your households daily routine.
Stay home if you are sick.
Stay home if you have COVID-19 symptoms.
If a member of your household is sick, stay home from school and work to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others.
Continue practicing everyday preventive actions.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol.
Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
Use the separate room and bathroom you prepared for sick household members (if possible).
Learn how to care for someone with COVID-19 at home.
Avoid sharing personal items like food and drinks.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email.
If you live alone and become sick during a COVID-19 outbreak, you may need help.
If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak.
Stay in touch with family and friends with chronic medical conditions.
Take care of the emotional health of your household members.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your schedule changes.
Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Remember, a COVID-19 outbreak could last a long time.
The impact on individuals, households, and communities might be great.
When public health officials determine the outbreak has ended in your community, take time to improve your households plan.
As public health officials continue to plan for COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks, you and your household also have an important role to play in ongoing planning efforts.
Discuss and note lessons learned.
Were your COVID-19 preparedness actions effective at home, school, and work?
Talk about problems found in your plan and effective solutions.
Identify additional resources needed for you and your household.
Participate in community discussions about emergency planning.
Let others know about what readiness actions worked for you and your household.
Maintain communication lines with your community (e.g social media and email lists).
Promote the importance of practicing good personal health habits.
Continue to practice everyday preventive actions.
Stay home when you are sick; cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue; wash your hands often with soap and water; and clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily.
Take care of the emotional health of your household members.
Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade.
Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19.
Connect with family and friends.
Share your concerns and how you are feeling with others.
Help your child/children cope after the outbreak.
Provide children with opportunities to talk about what they went through or what they think about it.
Encourage them to share concerns and ask questions.
Because parents, teachers, and other adults see children in different situations, it is important for them to work together to share information about how each child is coping after the outbreak.
CDC Interim Guidance for Specific Audiences
How to Protect Those That Are Most Vulnerable
This guidance is intended for people living together in close quarters, such as people who share a small apartment, or for people who live in the same household with large or extended families.
Older adults (65 and older) and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The following information is aimed to help you protect those who are most vulnerable in your household.
If your household includes one or more vulnerable individuals then all family members should act as if they, themselves, are at higher risk.
More information on steps and actions to take if at higher risk.
Family members should leave only when absolutely necessary.
Essential errands include going to the grocery store, pharmacy, or medical appointments that cannot be delayed (e.g infants or individuals with serious health conditions in need of aid).
If you must leave the house, please do the following:
Adults 65 years and older and people who have serious medical conditions should avoid caring for the children in their household, if possible.
If people at higher risk must care for the children in their household, the children in their care should not have contact with individuals outside the household.
Provide a separate bedroom and bathroom for the person who is sick, if possible.
If you cannot provide a separate room and bathroom, try to separate them from other household members as much as possible.
Keep people at higher risk separated from anyone who is sick.
Grocery Shopping, Take-Out, Banking, Getting Gas, and Doctor Visits.
As communities across the United States take steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting close contact, people are facing new challenges and questions about how to meet basic household needs, such as buying groceries and medicine, and completing banking activities.
The following information provides advice about how to meet these household needs in a safe and healthy manner.
Find additional information for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
If you or a member of your household has signs of COVID-19, call your doctor first, instead of going to the office or the emergency department.
Call 911 if you believe it is an emergency.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people.
Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children.
Coping with stress will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger.
Stress during an infectious disease outbreak can include
How you respond to the outbreak can depend on your background, the things that make you different from other people, and the community you live in.
People who may respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include
Taking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with stress.
Helping others cope with their stress can also make your community stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others
Sharing the facts about COVID-19.
Understanding the risk to yourself and people you care about can make an outbreak less stressful.
When you share accurate information about COVID-19, you can help make people feel less stressed and make a connection with them.

Children and teens react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them.
When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children.
Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared.
Not all children and teens respond to stress in the same way.
Some common changes to watch for include
Related: Caring for Children and Helping Children Cope
People at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults, and people with underlying health conditions are also at increased risk of stress due to COVID-19.
Special considerations include:
Check in with your loved ones often.
Virtual communication can help you and your loved ones feel less lonely and isolated.
Consider connecting with loved ones by:
Help keep your loved ones safe.
Take care of your own emotional health.
Caring for a loved one can take an emotional toll, especially during an outbreak like COVID-19.
There are ways to support yourself.
Stay home if you are sick.
Do not visit family or friends who are at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Use virtual communication to keep in touch to support your loved one and keep them safe.
Community preparedness planning for COVID-19 should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration.
It can be stressful to be separated from others if a healthcare provider thinks you may have been exposed to COVID-19, even if you do not get sick.
Everyone feels differently after coming out of quarantine.
Emotional reactions to coming out of quarantine may include
Children may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has been released from quarantine.
Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you, and you may experience secondary traumatic stress.
Secondary traumatic stress is stress reactions and symptoms resulting from exposure to another individuals traumatic experiences, rather than from exposure directly to a traumatic event.
There are things you can do to reduce secondary traumatic stress reactions:

It is important to remember that people – including those of Asian descent – who do not live in or have not recently been in an area of ongoing spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, or have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans.
Public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are stressful times for people and communities.
Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma(1) toward people, places, or things.
For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease.
Stigma can also occur after a person has been released from COVID-19 quarantine even though they are not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others.
Some groups of people who may be experiencing stigma because of COVID-19 include:
Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger towards other people.
Stigmatized groups may be subjected to:
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health(2) of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient(3).
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.

Related: Talking to Children About COVID-19
The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible.
While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households.
If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.
To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.
Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
This is especially important if you have been in a public place.
Revise spring break and travel plans if they included non-essential travel.
If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk.
Children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms, but they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Children 2 years and older should wear a cloth face covering their nose and mouth when in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is more to learn about how the disease impacts children.
You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on Are You at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.
Messages for parents, school staff, and others working with children
As public conversations around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19.
Parents, family members, school staff, and other trusted adults can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear.
CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease.
Make yourself available to listen and to talk.
Avoid language that might blame others and lead to stigma.
Pay attention to what children see or hear on television, radio, or online.
Provide information that is honest and accurate.
Teach children everyday actions to reduce the spread of germs.
Try to keep information simple and remind them that health and school officials are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy.

Protect Yourself and Others from COVID-19
Staying physically active is one of the best ways to keep your mind and body healthy.
In many areas, people can visit parks, trails, and open spaces as a way to relieve stress, get some fresh air and vitamin D, stay active, and safely connect with others.
Know Before You Go: While these facilities and areas can offer health benefits, it is important that you follow the steps below to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
check icon Visit parks that are close to your home
check icon Prepare before you visit
check icon Stay at least 6 feet away from others (social distancing) and take other steps to prevent COVID-19
check icon Play it safe around and in swimming pools.
Keep space between yourself and others
times icon Visit parks if you are sick or were recently exposed to COVID-19
times icon Visit crowded parks
times icon Use playgrounds
times icon Use hot tubs, spas, water playgrounds, or water parks
times icon Participate in organized activities or sports.
Traveling long distances to visit a park may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 as:
State and local authorities will decide whether parks and other recreational facilities will open.
Check with the park in advance to be sure you know which areas or services are open, such as bathroom facilities and concessions, and bring what you need with you.
The National Park Serviceexternal iconexternal icon will decide on a park-by-park basis whether a national park will be open.
Please check with individual parksexternal iconexternal icon for specific details since, in many cases, visitor centers, concessions, and bathroom facilities might be closed.
State and local authorities will decide whether natural bodies of water and beaches or swim areas will be open.
Please check with individual beaches or swim areas for specific details.
If a park, beach, or recreational facility is open for public use, visiting is okay as long as you practice social distancing and everyday steps such as washing hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.
Follow these actions when visiting a park, beach, or recreational facility:
Do not use playgrounds, including water playgrounds, located within local, state, or national parks.
Using playgrounds might lead to the spread of COVID-19 because:
In general, most organized activities and sports such as basketball, baseball, soccer, and football that are held on park fields, open areas, and courts are not recommended.
These activities and sports typically require coaches and athletes who are not from the same household or living unit to be in close proximity, which increases their potential for exposure to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the water.
Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (with chlorine or bromine) of pools should kill COVID-19.
Swimming and other water-related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity needed for a healthy life.
If you are not sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it is safe to use swimming pools as long as steps are taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19:
Swimming does carry some health risks.
Visit CDCs Healthy Swimming website for information to help you prevent illness and drowning, while having fun and enjoying the health benefits of swimming.
While proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (with chlorine or bromine) should kill COVID-19 in hot tubs, spas, water playgrounds, and water parks, you should not use these facilities within local, state, or national parks at this time because:
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.
Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats.
Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans.
Some coronaviruses that infect animals can sometimes be spread to humans and then spread between people, but this is rare.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people.
This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19.
However, we do not know the exact source of this virus.
Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19.
The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person.
The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking.
Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reportedexternal icon to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Only a few of the animals reported to be positive showed signs of illness.
The first caseexternal icon in the United States of an animal testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
Samples from this tiger were collected and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed signs of respiratory illness.
Public health officials believe these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
This investigation is ongoing.
We are still learning about this virus, but we know that it originally came from an animal source and is primarily spreading from person-to-person, but  it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
CDC is working with human and animal health partners to monitor this situation and will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.
Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pets health.
If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people.
Until we know more about this virus, people sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals.
If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.
In the United States, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low..
However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.

If you have a fever or cough, you might have COVID-19.
Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home.
If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider immediately.
A guide to help you make decisions and seek appropriate medical care
Follow the steps below:  If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community.
As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home.
Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.
If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a cloth face covering.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Note: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical grade facemasks are reserved for healthcare workers and some first responders.
You may need to improvise a cloth face covering using a scarf or bandana.
The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider and state and local health departments.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
What you can do if you have possible or confirmed COVID-19:
There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19.
People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms.
For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.
If you are caring for someone with COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings, follow this advice to protect yourself and others.
Learn what to do when someone has symptoms of COVID-19 or when someone has been diagnosed with the virus.
This information also pertains to people who have tested positive but are not showing symptoms.
*Note: Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, or diabetes, are at higher risk for developing more severe illness from COVID-19.
People at higher risk of severe illness should call their doctor as soon as symptoms start.
People who develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 should  call 911 right away.
Emergency warning signs include*:
*This is not every emergency symptom or sign.
COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets, created when someone talks, coughs or sneezes
Avoid having visitors: Avoid having any unnecessary visitors, especially visits by people who are at higher risk for severe illness.
Clean hands after taking off gloves or handling used items.

COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting sick.
You may feel increased stress during this pandemic.
Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions.
Learn about stress and coping.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild symptoms to severe illness and death.
Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.
Watch for fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Watch for symptoms.
A care plan summarizes your health conditions, medications, healthcare providers, emergency contacts, and end-of-life care options (for example, advance directives).
Complete your care plan in consultation with your doctor, and if needed, with help from a family member or home nurse aide.
A care plan can have benefits beyond the current pandemic.
You can update your care plan every year, or any time you have a change in your health or medications.
Care plans can help reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and improve overall medical management for people with a chronic health condition, resulting in better quality of life.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, having a care plan is an important part of emergency preparedness.
People with loved ones in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other types of senior living facilities may be understandably concerned about their loved ones risk of illness from COVID-19.
To protect these vulnerable friends and family members, CDC has advised that long-term care facilities
8 out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older.

This information is based on what we currently know about the spread and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.
There is currently no specific treatment for or vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
Contact your health care provider to ask about your symptoms.
Although the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 for people with HIV is not known, people with HIV may have concerns and questions related to their risk.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will provide updated information as it becomes available.
At the present time, we have no specific information about the risk of COVID-19 in people with HIV.
Older adults and people of any age who have a serious underlying medical condition might be at higher risk for severe illness, including people who are immunocompromised.
The risk for people with HIV getting very sick is greatest in:
People with HIV can also be at increased risk of getting very sick with COVID-19 based on their age and other medical conditions.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The best way to prevent getting sick is to avoid exposure to the virus.
People with HIV should take everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
People with HIV should also continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
This includes:
Staying healthy helps your immune system fight off infection should it occur.
If you have HIV and are taking your HIV medicine, it is important to continue your treatment and follow the advice of your health care provider.
This is the best way to keep your immune system healthy.
Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms that could be consistent with COVID-19.
Discuss how to get evaluated and how to avoid potentially exposing others to COVID-19.
Learn more about COVID-19 and what to do if you get sick.
Nearly half of people in the United States with diagnosed HIV are aged 50 years and older.
People with HIV also have higher rates of certain underlying health conditions.
Both increased age and these conditions can increase their risk for more severe illness if people with HIV get COVID-19, especially people with advanced HIV.
Steps that people with HIV can take to prepare in addition to what is recommended for everybody:
Some types of HIV medicine (for example, lopinavir-ritonavir) to treat COVID-19 are being evaluated.
Results from a clinical trialexternal icon in China showed that lopinavir-ritonavir did not speed up recovery or reduce the amount of virus produced in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia.
More than 15 clinical trials of HIV medicines are registered on ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.
Until more is known about the effects of these medicines on COVID-19, people with HIV should not switch their HIV medicine in an attempt to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Drug shortages or anticipated problems with HIV medicine have not been identified.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is closely monitoring the drug supply chain as the COVID-19 outbreak has the potential to disrupt the supply of medical and pharmaceutical products in the United States.
The National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD) has also remained in contact with the major manufacturers of HIV medicine as many of these products rely on ingredients produced in China.
As of March 10, 2020, there were no reports of manufacturing concerns or supply shortages.

COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe illness.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
We are learning more about COVID-19 every day; CDC will update the advice below as new information becomes available.
Learn what else you can do as someone who may be at higher risk for severe illness, including staying home and away from other people as much as possible.
Moderate-to-severe asthma may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness.
Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
Based on data from other viral respiratory infections, COVID-19 might cause flare-ups of chronic lung diseases leading to severe illness.
Diabetes, including type 1, type 2, or gestational, may put people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
People with diabetes whose blood sugar levels are often higher than their target are more likely to have diabetes-related health problems.
Those health problems can make it harder to overcome COVID-19.
Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
COVID-19, like other viral illnesses such as the flu, can damage the respiratory system and make it harder for your heart to work.
For people with heart failure and other serious heart conditions this can lead to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.
Chronic kidney disease being treated with dialysis may increase a persons risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
Dialysis patients are more prone to infection and severe illness because of weakened immune systems; treatments and procedures to manage kidney failure; and coexisting conditions such as diabetes.
Severe obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above, puts people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
Severe obesity increases the risk of a serious breathing problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major complication of COVID-19 and can cause difficulties with a doctors ability to provide respiratory support for seriously ill patients.
People living with severe obesity can have multiple serious chronic diseases and underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
Although COVID-19 can affect any group, the older you are, the higher your risk of serious disease.
Eight out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years or older; risk of death is highest among those 85 years or older.
The immune systems of older adults weaken with age, making it harder to fight off infections.
Also, older adults commonly have chronic diseases that can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Many cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have occurred among older adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities
Why you might be at higher risk
The communal nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, and the population served (generally older adults often with underlying medical conditions), put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness from COVID-19.
Many conditions and treatments can cause a person to have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised), including cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell count or not on HIV treatment, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications.
Why you might be at higher risk
People with a weakened immune system have reduced ability to fight infectious diseases, including viruses like COVID-19.
Knowledge is limited about the virus that causes COVID-19, but based on similar viruses, there is concern that immunocompromised patients may remain infectious for longer than other COVID-19 patients.
Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, may increase risk for serious illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
Severe illness caused by COVID-19 and the medications used to treat some severe consequences of COVID-19 can cause strain on the liver, particularly for those with underlying liver problems.
People living with serious liver disease can have a weakened immune system, leaving the body less able to fight COVID-19.
Moderate-to-severe asthma may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Why you might be at higher risk
COVID-19 can affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs), cause an asthma attack, and possibly lead to pneumonia and serious illness.
Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

People living with serious liver disease can have a weakened immune system, leaving the body less able to fight COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.
Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.
All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious underlying chronic medical conditions like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system.
Adults with disabilities are three times more likely than adults without disabilities to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness.
You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider.
If you or someone you care for are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting sick.
In addition to practicing everyday preventive actions, people with disabilities who have direct support providers can help protect themselves from respiratory illness in the following ways:
There are some additional things people with disabilities can do to prepare during the COVID-19 outbreak:
There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.
There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms.
People who are homeless are at risk of COVID-19.
Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection.
Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at higher risk for severe disease.
Health departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group.
If possible, identifying non-congregate settings where those at highest risk can stay may help protect them from COVID-19.
Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID-19 may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do.
Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should:
Any person experiencing homelessness with symptoms consistent with COVID-19  (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers).
These staff will help the individual understand how to isolate themselves and identify options for medical care as needed.
If they meet criteria for testing, people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing through a healthcare provider.
Local public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics.
Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can best be isolated from other people to prevent spreading the infection.
Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems, and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they meet the criteria to end isolation.
Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people.
If no other options are available, homeless service providers should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support.
Homeless service providers can accept donations of food and clothing during community spread of COVID-19, but general infection control precautions should be taken.
Request that donors not donate if they are sick.
Homeless shelters can screen clients for symptoms of respiratory infections.
Clients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19.
Make sure they have a separate place they can safely stay within the shelter or at an alternate site in coordination with local health authorities.
An on-site nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments.
Notify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer clients that the client might have COVID-19.
Homeless shelters serve a critical function in our communities.
Shelters should stay open unless homeless service providers, health departments, and housing authorities have determined together that a shelter needs to close.
Connecting people to stable housing should continue to be a priority.

We do not currently know if pregnant people have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result.
Based on available information, pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant.

The effects of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups is still emerging; however, current data suggest a disproportionate burden of illness and death among racial and ethnic minority groups.
A recent CDC MMWR report included race and ethnicity data from 580 patients hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19 found that 45% of individuals for whom race or ethnicity data was available were white, compared to 55% of individuals in the surrounding community.
However, 33% of hospitalized patients were black compared to 18% in the community and 8% were Hispanic, compared to 14% in the community.
These data suggest an overrepresentation of blacks among hospitalized patients.
Among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, New York Citypdf iconexternal icon identified death rates among Black/African American persons (92.3 deaths per 100,000 population) and Hispanic/Latino persons (74.3) that were substantially higher than that of white (45.2) or Asian (34.5) persons.
Studies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities.
Where We Live, Learn,
Work, and Play Affects Our Health
The conditions in which people live, learn, work, and play contribute to their health.
These conditions, over time, lead to different levels of health risks, needs, and outcomes among some people in certain racial and ethnic minority groups.
Health differences between racial and ethnic groups are often due to economic and social conditions that are more common among some racial and ethnic minorities than whites.
In public health emergencies, these conditions can also isolate people from the resources they need to prepare for and respond to outbreaks.1,13, 14
For many people in racial and ethnic minority groups, living conditions may contribute to underlying health conditions and make it difficult to follow steps to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or to seek treatment if they do get sick.
The types of work and policies in the work environments where people in some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk for getting sick with COVID-19.
Examples include:
Existing health disparities, such as poorer underlying health and barriers to getting health care, might make members of many racial and ethnic minority groups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of COVID-19.
History shows that severe illness and death rates tend to be higher for racial and ethnic minority groups during public health emergencies.12 Addressing the needs of vulnerable populations in emergencies includes improving day-to-day life and harnessing the strengths of these groups.
Shared faith, family, and cultural institutions are common sources of social support.
These institutions can empower and encourage individuals and communities to take actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who become sick, and help community members cope with stress.
For example, families, churches and other groups in affected populations can help their communities face an epidemic by consulting CDC guidance documents for their organization type.
Stay home and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness or if you may have issues getting assistance if you get sick.
If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease.
Related: How to Protect Yourself
Older people and people of any age who have serious underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
People who may have issues getting assistance if they become ill, like those experiencing homelessness or people with disabilities are also at increased risk from COVID-19.
These conditions and situations may result in increased stress during this pandemic.
Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions.
Things you can do to support yourself:
Related: Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home
Depending on how severe the outbreak is, your local public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce peoples risk of being exposed to COVID-19.
These actions can slow the spread and reduce the impact of disease.
Stay home as much as possible.
Take extra measures to put distance between yourself and other people to further reduce your risk of being exposed to this new virus.

Community preparedness planning for COVID-19 should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration.
Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their health and independence.
Long-term care facilities should be vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19.
See guidance for long-term care facilities.

A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.
See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.
In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.
While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.
You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness.
You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.
You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online.
No.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.
In COVID-19, ‘CO stands for ‘corona, ‘VI for ‘virus, and ‘D for disease.
Formerly, this disease was referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases.
People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people.
Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring.
Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in.
Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.
See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19.
Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
CDCs COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners.
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people.
This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
All three of these viruses have their origins in bats.
The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.
More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest).
That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e.
time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.
The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure.
For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets.
Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety.
Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19.
Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.
Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments.
However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point.
The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.
Regardless of temperature please follow CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection.
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily.
The latest updates are available on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online.

Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.
There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.
This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example).
Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads.
Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging.
However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients.
The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations.
CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.
Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.

However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms.
Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough.
Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported.
Its not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs.
There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community.
Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation.
Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions.
A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.
Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children.
Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.
If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.
Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.
This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.
However, children do get the virus and become ill.
Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods.
Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school.
Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal.
Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs.
Its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens.
Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition.
The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system.
This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.
More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.
CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.
Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.
Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.
Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations.
You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your familys situation.
It is important to continue your familys coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.
See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:
If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your childs healthcare provider.
If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911.
If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.
Notify your childs healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.
See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.
If your childs healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:
Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:
Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same.
These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:
If you develop any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:
*This list is not all inclusive.
Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19.
If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan.
Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals.
If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schools plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
Plan for potential changes at your workplace.
Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options.
Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.
See CDCs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.
Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon.
Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.
See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.
During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work.
Follow the steps below:
Put your household plan into action.
Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals.
Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childs school.
If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friends house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
Follow the advice of your local health officials.
Stay home if you can.
Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childs school is dismissed temporarily.
Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses.
CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities.
These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  stay at home or shelter in place.
What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities.
These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more.
CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.
CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.
Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.
If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you.
Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.
CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.
CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.
In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department.
Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
The process and locations for testing vary from place to place.
Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider.
State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers.
While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.
See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the persons sample.
In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.
Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes.
Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.
Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested).
Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses.
You can find a patient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.
In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency.
A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit – the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit.
You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
For more information please see FDAs most recent press releaseexternal icon.
Serology testing checks a sample of a persons blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus.
CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured serology tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers.
This evaluation is expected to be completed in late April.
We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone.
Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.
Serology tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
To tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once.
At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected.
Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.
Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:
If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible.
Watch for symptoms and emergency signs.
If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.
More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.
As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible.
Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.
CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more.
People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:
Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodys function.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.
Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19.
The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their communitys cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time).
Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19.
Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19.
If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected.
For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.
Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted.
During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g.
disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator).
Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label.
Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin.
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State.
Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies.
If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444.
For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer.
In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy.
Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer.
There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
Please see CDCs guidance for additional information.
CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response.
This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available.
CDC works 24/7 to protect peoples health.
More information about CDCs response to COVID-19 is available online.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses.
These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCs Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
No.
At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.
We dont know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings.
Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.
Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.
These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.
We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations.
CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19.
A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Walking a dog is important for both animal and human health and well-being.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
Do not go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.
There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19.
Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.
If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.
Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19.
Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.
Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pets treatment and care.
Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances.
Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis.
For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animals veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.
Please refer to CDCs requirements for bringing a dog to the United States.
The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States.
At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness.
If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian.
Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.
The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City.
However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we dont know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.
Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:
Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats.
In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we dont yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick.
Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.
However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people.
Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.g being coughed on)
If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met
See CDCs updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
The COVID-19 outbreak in United States is a rapidly evolving situation.
The status of the outbreak varies by location and state and local authorities are updating their guidance frequently.
The White Houses Opening Up America Againexternal icon plan means some parts of the country may have different guidance than other areas.
Check with the state or local authorities where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination to learn about local circumstances and any restrictions that may be in place.
Cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in all states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease.
Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19.
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible, especially if your trip is not essential, and practice social distancing especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
Dont travel if you are sick or travel with someone who is sick.
As communities across the United States take steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting close contact, people are facing new challenges and questions about how to safely run essential errands to meet basic household needs, like:
CDC provides advice about how to meet these essential household needs in a safe and healthy manner on another webpage; content on this page is about travel.
Some travel may also be essential, like:
The following travel recommendations provide advice about how to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 if you must travel.
Dont travel if you are sick or plan to travel with someone who is sick.
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
If you must travel, there are several things you should consider before you go.
Some types of travel (bus, plane, train) may require sitting next to others for a period of time.
Travel may also expose you to new parts of the country with differing levels of community transmission.
And, if youre infected, your travel may put others at risk– along the way, at your destination, and when you return home.
If you must travel, consider the following risks you might face, depending on what type of travel you are planning:
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
If you must travel, follow any state and local travel restrictions currently in place.
It is possible that some state and local governments may put in place travel restrictions, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines upon arrival, or even state border closures while you are traveling.
For more information and travel guidance, check with the state or local health department where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination.
Just because there are no restrictions at the time you plan to leave does not mean there wont be restrictions in place when you arrive.
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
Staying in temporary accommodations (hotels, motels, and rental properties) may expose you to the virus through person-to-person contact and possibly through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
However, if you must travel, be aware that many businesses (such as restaurants and hotels) may be closed.
Anticipate your needs before you go:
Dont travel if you are sick or plan to travel with someone who is sick.
If you must travel, protect yourself and others during your trip:
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing.
Traveling to visit friends and family increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19.
It is possible for someone to have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they have no symptoms.
Getting infected may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19.
People at higher risk for complications need to take extra precautions.
Although it can be hard to remain apart from loved ones during challenging or stressful times, try to connect with them in other ways, using video chats or phone calls.
CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at higher risk of severe illness.
Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities at campsites or along the trails.
This is because it is possible for someone to have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they have no symptoms.
Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19 and are planning to be in remote areas, far away from medical care.
Also be aware that many local, state, and national public parks have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19.
This HAN Update was updated on March 17, 2020 to include additional pre-travel advice about in-cabin isolation if patients become sick during a cruise and 14-day quarantine following completion of any cruise.
This language is consistent with CDCs new Level 3 Travel Warning for cruise ships.

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all persons defer any travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide because of the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard ships.
Deferring travel is especially important for older adults and all people with serious chronic medical conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease), because of their increased risk for severe disease.
This health update provides information to clinicians and state and local health departments about the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation and the risks associated with travel on cruise ships, including river cruises.
Background
Cruise ship passengers, including those who take river cruises, are at increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
In the past month, there have been reports of outbreaks of COVID-19 among passengers and crew on cruises.
Recent examples include 696 cases and 8 deaths on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, 28 cases on the Grand Princess cruise ship in the United States, and at least 60 cases in 15 states associated with multiple Nile River voyages in Egypt as of March 14, 2020.
Illness onset occurred both onboard ships and after passengers returned to the United States.
The proximity of passengers and crew on small ships and boats traveling on rivers may result in an even higher number of COVID-19 infections.
Recommendations for Clinicians 
Ask all patients about their planned or recent cruise ship travel, including river cruises.
Recommendations for State and Local Health Departments
Check The Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) notification system for information on COVID-19 cases on cruise ships and river cruises.
In accordance with the Level 3 travel warning (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship) for cruise ships, cruise travelers should stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.
For More Information 
State and local health departments can contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours, weekends, or holidays.

Summary
Chloroquine phosphate, when used without a prescription and supervision of a healthcare provider, can cause serious health consequences, including death.
Clinicians and public health officials should discourage the public from misusing non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate (a chemical used in home aquariums).
Clinicians should advise patients and the public that chloroquine, and the related compound hydroxychloroquine, should be used only under the supervision of a healthcare provider as prescribed medications.
Background
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has become aware of two individuals who ingested non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate, a chemical for aquarium use that is commercially available for purchase at stores and through internet websites.
One of the individuals died shortly after arrival to the hospital.
The second individual was critically ill with severe gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac conduction abnormalities.
Upon recovery, the surviving individual reported to the media that they ingested the product to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), after seeing information on the medical use of chloroquine on television.
The product in their possession was in powder form inside a 2.2-lb.
container and labeled for Ornamental Fish Use Only.
CDC is also aware of unconfirmed media reports that these commercially available aquarium-use chemicals may be out of stock due to potential increased demand by the public.
At this time, there are no routinely available pharmaceutical products that are FDA-approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
Pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat specific medical conditions, such as malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Currently, these medications are being studied and evaluated as treatment for COVID-19; however, their efficacy to either prevent or treat this infection are unknown.
In overdose situations or when used inappropriately, these medications can lead to severe toxicity, including cardiac rhythm disturbances such as prolonged QT, severe hypokalemia, cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and death.
Inappropriate uses include taking commercially available non-pharmaceutical preparations, taking chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate without a prescription, and taking additional doses not recommended by a healthcare provider.
Chloroquine phosphate has a narrow therapeutic index—it can be toxic at levels not much higher than those used for treatment—which raises the risk of inadvertent overdose.
Recommendations for Clinicians and Public Health Officials

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update highlights guidance and recommendations for evaluating and identifying patients who should be tested for COVID-19 that were shared on March 4, 2020, on the CDC COVID-19 website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html.
It supersedes the guidance and recommendations provided in CDCs HAN 428 distributed on February 28, 2020.
The outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 101 other countries and territories, including the United States.
As of March 8, 2020, there were more than 105,000 cases reported globally.
In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is now community spread in several additional countries.
CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).
As of March 7, 2020, there were a total of 213 cases within the United States, of which, 49 were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings.
Among the other 164 cases that were diagnosed in the United States, 36 were among persons with a history of recent travel in China or other affected areas, and 18 were persons in close contact with another confirmed COVID-19 patient (i.e person-to-person spread); 110 cases are currently under investigation.
During the week of February 23, community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 was reported in California in two places, Oregon, and Washington.
Community spread in Washington resulted in the first reported case of COVID-19 in a healthcare worker, and the first outbreak in a long-term care facility.
The first death due to COVID-19 was also reported from Washington; there have now been 11 reported deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19.
As of March 7, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported by 19 states.
CDC will continue to work with state and local health departments, clinicians, and laboratorians to identify and respond to other cases of COVID-19, especially those with an unknown source of infection, to limit further community spread.
The most recent update describing COVID-19 in the United States can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html.
Recognizing persons who are at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission.
With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and the criteria for considering testing are being updated to reflect this spread.
In addition, with increasing access to testing, the criteria for testing for COVID-19 have been expanded to include more symptomatic persons, even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case, to quickly detect and respond to community spread of the virus in the United States.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19
Clinicians should work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories.
In addition, COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories.
This additional testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients.
Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested.
Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever1 and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g cough, difficulty breathing).
Priorities for testing may include:
There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing.
Documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction and known community transmission may contribute to an epidemiologic risk assessment to inform testing decisions.
Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g influenza).
Mildly ill patients should be encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management.
Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately.
Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness.
International Areas with Sustained (Ongoing) Transmission
Last updated March 8, 2020
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html)
Recommendations for Reporting, Laboratory Testing, and Specimen Collection
Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19.
They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if it is suspected that a patient may have COVID-19.
State health departments that have identified a person suspected of having COVID-19 or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html).
If specimens are sent to CDC for laboratory testing, state and local health departments can contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping, including after hours, on weekends, and holidays.
Guidance for the identification and management of potentially exposed contacts of a confirmed case of COVID-19 can be found in Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposures: Geographic Risk and Contacts of Laboratory-confirmed Cases (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html).
Separate guidance for the management of potentially exposed contacts of a COVID-19 case who are healthcare personnel is provided in Interim U.S.
Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html).
For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs).
CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available.
For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2.
The induction of sputum is not recommended.
For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen.
Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a person has been identified for testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset.
See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html) and Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected cases and PUIs (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/biosafety-faqs.html).
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed
2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation.
Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel.S.

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides updated guidance on evaluating and testing persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19.
It supersedes guidance provided in CDCs HAN 427 distributed on February 1, 2020.
The outbreak that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has now spread throughout China and to 46 other countries and territories, including the United States.
As of February 27, 2020, there were 78,497 reported cases in China and 3,797 cases in locations outside China.
In addition to sustained transmission in China, there is evidence of community spread in several additional countries.
CDC has updated travel guidance to reflect this information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).
To date, there has been limited spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
As of February 26, 2020, there were a total of 61 cases within the United States, 46 of these were among repatriated persons from high-risk settings.
The other 15 cases were diagnosed in the United States; 12 were persons with a history of recent travel in China and 2 were persons in close household contact with a COVID-19 patient (i.e.
person-to-person spread).
One patient with COVID-19 who had no travel history or links to other known cases was reported on February 26, 2020, in California.
The California Department of Public Health, local health departments, clinicians, and CDC are working together to investigate this case and are identifying contacts with whom this individual interacted.
CDC, state and local health departments, other federal agencies, and other partners have been implementing measures to slow and contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.
These measures include assessing, monitoring, and caring for travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission and identifying cases and contacts of cases in the United States.
Recognizing persons at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission.
With expanding spread of COVID-19, additional areas of geographic risk are being identified and PUI criteria are being updated to reflect this spread.
To prepare for possible additional person-to-person spread of COVID-19 in the United States, CDC continues to recommend that clinicians and state and local health departments consider COVID-19 in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the absence of travel history to affected areas or known exposure to another case.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Testing of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19
Local or state health departments, in consultation with clinicians, should determine whether a patient is a PUI for COVID-19.
The CDC clinical criteria for COVID-19 PUIs have been developed based on available information about this novel virus, as well as what is known about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/guidance.html) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html#evaluation).
These criteria are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
These criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation.
In consultation with public health departments, patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the need for testing.
Testing may be considered for deceased persons who would otherwise meet the PUI criteria.
1Fever may be subjective or confirmed.
2For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation.
Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel.S.
Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html).cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html).
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to healthcare personnel exposed in healthcare settings, as described in CDCs Interim U.S.
Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html).
4Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for COVID-19 patients in other countries.
5Affected areas are defined as geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified.
Relevant affected areas will be defined as a country with at least a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice.
Current information is available in CDCs COVID-19 Travel Health Notices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers).
6Category includes single or clusters of patients with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) of unknown etiology in which COVID-19 is being considered.
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection
Clinicians should immediately implement recommended infection prevention and control practices (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) if a patient is suspected of having COVID-19.
They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19.
State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a PUI and Case Report form through the processes identified on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html).
State and local health departments can contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays.
Currently, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is being performed at state public health laboratories and CDC.Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen testing for COVID-19.
For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs).
CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available.
For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2.

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that was initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
This CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) Update provides a situational update and interim guidance to state and local health departments that supersedes guidance in CDCs HAN 426 distributed on January 17, 2020.
It also adds
Early in the outbreak, many of the patients with respiratory illness caused by 2019-nCoV in China had exposure to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-human transmission.
More recently, cases have been confirmed with no exposure to animal markets, indicating that person-to-person spread of the virus has occurred.
Chinese officials report that sustained person-to-person spread in the community is occurring in China.
The first US case-patient was identified on January 21, 2020, and had recently traveled from Wuhan, China.
Since that time, six additional cases have been confirmed in the United States, four among persons who traveled from Wuhan, and one a close contact of a confirmed case.
Globally, reported illnesses in people with 2019-nCoV have ranged from mild (no or few signs and symptoms), to severe, including death.
These findings are consistent with other coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html).
The goal of the ongoing US public health response is to identify and contain this outbreak and prevent sustained spread of 2019-nCoV in the United States.
Recommendations for Screening of Patients for 2019-nCoV in Healthcare Facilities 
Recommendations for screening of patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection are based on (1) current knowledge of the characteristics of clinical illness observed in early cases, and (2) the geographic distribution of current cases.
They reflect the current public health goal of rapidly containing and preventing transmission of 2019-nCoV illness.
Patients presenting to healthcare facilities should be assessed for exposures associated with risk of 2019-nCoV infections (e.g travel to China or close contact with a confirmed case) and for symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html).
The assessment is intended to allow healthcare providers to make decisions about appropriate infection control and management of patients.
Note that the signs and symptoms of 2019-nCoV overlap with those associated with other viral respiratory tract infections.
Given the time of year, common respiratory illnesses, including influenza, should also be considered in patients who are screened.

If a patient meets these criteria:
Clinicians should immediately notify the healthcare facilitys infection control personnel and local health department.
The health department will determine if this patient needs to be considered a PUI for 2019-nCoV and be tested for infection.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Testing of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV
Local health departments, in consultation with clinicians, should determine whether a patient is a PUI for 2019-nCoV.
The CDC clinical criteria for 2019-nCoV PUIs have been developed based on available information about this novel virus, as well as what is known about SARS and MERS.
These criteria are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
These criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation and testing.
Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis for possible 2019-nCoV infection.
Testing decisions might be further informed by the clinical presentation or exposure history (e.g uncertain travel or exposure), and the presence of an alternative diagnosis that explains their clinical presentation.
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection
Healthcare providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility if a patient is classified a PUI for 2019-nCoV.
State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html#reporting-testing-specimen-collection).
CDCs EOC will assist local and state health departments with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC, including afterhours or on weekends or holidays.
Currently, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be done only at CDC.
Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC.
For initial diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory (nasopharyngeal AND oropharyngeal swabs), and lower respiratory (sputum, if possible)) for those patients with productive coughs.
Induction of sputum is not indicated.
Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset.
See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html).
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
No vaccine or specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is available.
At present, medical care for patients with 2019-nCoV is supportive.
Persons with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infection who are hospitalized should be evaluated and cared for in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room, if available.
For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a Healthcare Setting (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/infection-control.html).
Home care and isolation may be an option, based on clinical and public health assessment, for some persons.
Please see Interim Guidance for Preventing the Spread of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Homes and Communities (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html).
Those isolated at home should be monitored by public health officials to the extent possible.

Notes
1Close contact is defined as:
a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a 2019-nCoV case for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); close contact can include caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a 2019-nCoV case
– or –
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a 2019-nCoV case (e.g being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment.
2Fever may be subjective or confirmed
See CDCs updated Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a Healthcare Setting (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control.html).
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with 2019-nCoV (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.
3 Documentation of laboratory-confirmation of 2019-nCoV may not be possible for travelers or persons caring for patients in other countries.
4 Category also includes any member of a cluster of patients with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g pneumonia, ARDS) of unknown etiology in which 2019-nCoV is being considered that requires hospitalization.
Such persons should be evaluated in consultation with state and local health departments regardless of travel history.

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor an outbreak of a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that began in December 2019.
CDC has established an Incident Management System to coordinate a domestic and international public health response.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.
Some cause illness in people; numerous other coronaviruses circulate among animals, including camels, cats, and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html).
Chinese authorities report most patients in the Wuhan City outbreak have been epidemiologically linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak.
Chinese authorities additionally report that they are monitoring several hundred healthcare workers who are caring for outbreak patients; no spread of this virus from patients to healthcare personnel has been reported to date.
Chinese authorities are reporting no ongoing spread of this virus in the community, but they cannot rule out that some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring.
China has reported that two of the patients have died, including one with pre-existing medical conditions.
Chinese health officials publicly posted the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020.
This will facilitate identification of infections with this virus and development of specific diagnostic tests.
Thailand and Japan have confirmed additional cases of 2019-nCoV in travelers from Wuhan, China.
It is possible that more cases will be identified in the coming days.
This is an ongoing investigation and given previous experience with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it is possible that person-person spread may occur.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 2019-nCoV as the investigations in China, Thailand, and Japan continue.
This HAN Update provides a situational update and guidance to state and local health departments and healthcare providers that supersedes guidance in CDCs HAN Advisory 424 distributed on January 8, 2020.
This HAN Update adds guidance for evaluation of patients under investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV, prevention and infection control guidance, including the addition of an eye protection recommendation, and additional information on specimen collection.
Background
An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019.
Chinese health authorities have confirmed more than 40 infections with a novel coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak.
Reportedly, most patients had epidemiological links to a large seafood and animal market.
The market was closed on January 1, 2020.
Currently, Chinese health authorities report no community spread of this virus, and no transmission among healthcare personnel caring for outbreak patients.
No additional cases of infection with 2019-nCoV have been identified in China since January 3, 2020.
On January 13, 2020 public health officials in Thailand confirmed detection of a human infection with 2019-nCoV in a traveler from Wuhan, China.
This was the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV documented outside China.
On January 17, 2020 a second case was confirmed in Thailand, also in a returned traveler from Wuhan City.
On January 15, 2020 health officials in Japan confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in a returned traveler from Wuhan City.
These persons had onset dates after January 3, 2020.
These cases did not report visiting the large seafood and animal market to which many cases in China have been linked.
On January 11, 2020, CDC updated the level 1 travel health notice (practice usual precautions) for Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China with additional information (originally issued on January 6, 2020): https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china.
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with 2019-nCoV.
No vaccine or specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is available; care is supportive.
The CDC clinical criteria for a 2019-nCoV patient under investigation (PUI) have been developed based on what is known about MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Healthcare providers should obtain a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and acute respiratory illness.
CDC guidance for evaluating and reporting a PUI for MERS-CoV remains unchanged.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV
Patients in the United States who meet the following criteria should be evaluated as a PUI in association with the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City, China.
1) Fever1 AND symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g cough, shortness of breath)
–and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,
2) Fever1 OR symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g cough, shortness of breath)
–and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,
The above criteria are also available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html.
The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation.
Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g uncertain travel or exposure).
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection
Healthcare providers should immediately notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for 2019-nCoV.
State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdfpdf icon.
CDCs EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays.
At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC.
Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC.
If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI.
This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019 nCoV co-infections.
For biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.
To increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types—lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens.
Additional specimen types (e.g stool, urine) may be collected and stored.
Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset.
Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/.
Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019-nCoV
Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html).
Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available.
Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g goggles or a face shield).
Immediately notify your healthcare facilitys infection control personnel and local health department.
Additional Infection Control Practices Resources 
Notes
1Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain fever-lowering medications.
Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.
2Close contact with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV.
Close contact is defined as—

a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a novel coronavirus case for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); close contact can include caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a novel coronavirus case.
– or –
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a novel coronavirus case (e.g being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment.
See CDCs Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/infection-control.html).
Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited.
Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with novel coronavirus (e.g coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient).
Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds clinicians that influenza B viruses can cause severe illness in people of all ages, including children.
CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination and prompt antiviral treatment of high-risk outpatients and hospitalized patients with suspected influenza.
Summary
This health advisory notifies clinicians that influenza activity remains high in the United States.
Ongoing elevated activity is due to influenza B/Victoria viruses, increasing circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and low levels of influenza B/Yamagata and influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
CDCs influenza forecasts suggest that national influenza activity will remain elevated for several more weeks.
Because influenza activity is elevated and both influenza A and B virus infections can cause severe disease and death, this health advisory also serves as a reminder that early treatment with antiviral medications improves outcomes in patients with influenza.
Early treatment with antiviral medications is recommended for hospitalized patients and high-risk outpatients, including children younger than two years.
Clinicians should continue efforts to vaccinate patients for as long as influenza viruses are circulating, and promptly start antiviral treatment of severely ill and high-risk patients with suspected influenza without waiting for laboratory confirmation.
Background
In the United States, influenza activity remains elevated and widespread, and the season is likely to last several more weeks (see CDC FluView report for details: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm).
Since early this season, influenza B viruses, specifically B/Victoria viruses, have been reported more frequently than other influenza viruses, followed by A(H1N1)pdm09.
Different viruses have predominated in different parts of the country and among different age groups.
Influenza B viruses can cause severe illness in people of all ages, including children.1 In past seasons, the proportion of influenza-related pediatric deaths associated with influenza B viruses has generally been higher than the proportion of influenza B among circulating viruses,2,3 and pediatric mortality from influenza B–associated hospitalizations has been reported to be higher than with influenza A–associated hospitalizations.4 So far this season, influenza B virus infections account for about half of hospitalizations reported through CDCs laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization surveillance network and the majority of reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm).
Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are increasing and becoming predominant in some regions.
These viruses can also cause severe illness, particularly in adults not originally exposed to currently circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.5 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses currently comprise the majority of the other half of hospitalizations reported through CDCs laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization surveillance network.
CDC continues to recommend everyone six months of age and older get vaccinated for influenza.
CDC also recommends antiviral medications for the treatment of influenza, because antiviral treatment has shown clinical and public health benefit in reducing illness and lessening severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies during past influenza seasons and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.6-13 Influenza antiviral medications are most effective in treating influenza and reducing complications when treatment is started early (within 48 hours of illness onset).
Some studies suggest clinical benefit among hospitalized patients and young children with febrile illness even when treatment was started three to five days after illness onset.14-20 
Three drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors: oral oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), inhaled zanamivir (trade name Relenza®), and intravenous peramivir (trade name Rapivab®).
These medications block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses.
The fourth drug is oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action.
Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication.
In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within two days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial.22 In the clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in high-risk adolescents and adults, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms.
There are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women, immunocompromised people, those with severe disease, or hospitalized patients.
Recommended ages for treatment and prevention with antiviral medications are summarized in the table below.
Dosing and more detailed treatment considerations can be found in the Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm)
For outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment.
The recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is—
Oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is the only recommended antiviral medication for treating hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza and patients with severe or complicated illness with suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g pneumonia, exacerbation of underlying chronic medical condition) who are not hospitalized.
Please see the Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm) for considerations regarding dosing and duration of antiviral treatment for patients with severe or complicated influenza.
There are insufficient data for use of inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, and oral baloxavir in patients with severe influenza disease.
Oral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women.
Oseltamivir has been shown to be safe for treating pregnant women, and pregnant women are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people.
Baloxavir is not recommended for treating women or breastfeeding mothers, as there are no available efficacy or safety data.
A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in an ill child or adult.
High-risk patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider promptly if they have symptoms of influenza.
Specimens from all hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested with molecular assays with high sensitivity and specificity since influenza testing can help inform clinical management and prompt implementation of infection prevention and control measures for influenza.
Molecular assays (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR) should be used for influenza testing of hospitalized patients.
Treatment should be empiric and should start as soon as possible.23,24 Treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation.
The following figure may be used as a guide for considering influenza testing (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/consider-influenza-testing.htm for footnotes)

Additional influenza resources for health professionals are available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals.
In addition, www.vaccinefinder.orgexternal icon and www.medfinder.orgexternal icon, are available to help individuals find places to get age-appropriate influenza vaccines or fill prescriptions for influenza antivirals.

Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring a reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology (PUE) with possible epidemiologic links to a large wholesale fish and live animal market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
An outbreak investigation by local officials is ongoing in China; the World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead international public health agency.
Currently, there are no known U.S. cases nor have cases been reported in countries other than China.
CDC has established an Incident Management Structure to optimize domestic and international coordination if additional public health actions are required.
This HAN Advisory informs state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak and requests that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory disease about travel history to Wuhan City.
Wuhan City is a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with a population of more than 11 million people.
Background
According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO.
The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019.
Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph.
Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition.
No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission.
Reports indicate that some of the patients were vendors at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (South China Seafood Wholesale Market) where, in addition to seafood, chickens, bats, marmots, and other wild animals are sold, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak.
The market has been closed for cleaning and disinfection.
Local authorities have reported negative laboratory test results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among patients associated with this cluster.
Additional laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.
Health authorities are monitoring more than 150 contacts of patients for illness.
CDC has issued a level 1 travel notice (practice usual precautions) for this destination.
(https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/pneumonia-china).
On January 5, 2020, WHO posted an update on this situation, including an early risk assessment, which is available at: https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/external icon.
This guidance will be updated as more information becomes available.

Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people spend time close together and with travelers from many countries.
Disease can spread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships.
Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between countries.
For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across the globe.
Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk of COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order for cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US travelers to defer all cruise travel.
The No Sail Order is published in the Federal Register.
CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also protecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive efforts are needed to contain the spread.
CDC will continue to evaluate and update our recommendations as the situation evolves.
In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No Sail Order on March 14 to prevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships.
CDC extended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.
Among other things, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew.
The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:
The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers, cruise ship crews, and other industry workers.
By restricting cruise ship passenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:
The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial passenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an overnight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated.
The Order applies to all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US jurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended operations.
It does not apply to cargo ships.
Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information.
On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health notice with a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases on cruise ships.
The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.
We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19.
Just as the American public has a role to play by staying home to slow the spread, cruise lines have a role to play in properly caring for their crew, including isolating them if they are sick and quarantining them if they have been exposed.
Cruise lines should have their crew do the same thing that the American public has been asked to do:
CDC has provided clear guidance to cruise lines about how to keep their crew safe during the period of the No Sail Order, just as we have provided guidance to the American public.
Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to sick crew members as needed.
As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines should make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and other resources to provide care for sick people on board.
They also need a plan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical care that the ships medical facility cant provide.
CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are working with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to ensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if the ship cant provide it.
CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical evacuation for people in need of lifesaving support.
A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US waters.
These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.
CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help remaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.
These are cruise ships that had international voyages with US ports, which are under US CDC jurisdiction.
International voyages without US ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.
International cruise voyages were suspended on March 14, 2020, due to CDCs No Sail Order.
*CDC was notified about COVID-19-positive travelers who had symptoms while on board these ships.
For all other ships, CDC was notified about travelers who had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after disembarking.
Since these travelers symptoms began after the voyage, the traveler might have contracted COVID-19 during the voyage; however, other sources of transmission after the voyage cannot be ruled out.
COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe.
For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk.
These are commonly called risk factors.
Examples include being 65 years of age or older or having serious underlying medical conditions.
CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness.
This is one of the top priorities in CDCs strategy to combat COVID-19.
What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.
CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners.
People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection.
It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you:
Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications.
Potential risk factors that have been identified to date include:
Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a persons risk.
CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below.
These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.
Compare characteristics of people with COVID-19 who have symptoms with characteristics of people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms.
How people with COVID-19 who have symptoms are different from those with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms.
How people with COVID-19 who feel more sick (for example, sick enough to need to stay in bed or to seek medical care) are different from those with COVID-19 who feel less sick.
*Investigations used include: Ongoing household investigations
Compare characteristics of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized with characteristics of:
Characteristics associated with illness that is severe enough to require hospitalization among people with COVID-19.
*Surveillance networks and investigations used include: COVID-NET; The U.S.
Flu Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) network, New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN); Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN); and ongoing field investigations
Compare characteristics of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized in ICUs with characteristics of:
How people with COVID-19 who are sick enough to need ICU care are different from less sick people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized, people with COVID-19 who are not hospitalized, and the U.S. general population.
*Networks used include: Influenza Vaccine effectiveness in critically ill patients (IVY)
Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.
For surveillance of COVID-19, and the virus that causes it, SARS-COV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems run in collaboration with state, local, territorial, and academic partners to monitor COVID-19 disease in the United States.
COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources from existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, commercial lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new systems designed to answer specific questions.
These systems, combined, create an updated, accurate picture of SARS-COV-2 spread and its effects in the United States and provide data used to inform the U.S. national public health response to COVID-19.
COVID-19 data can be used to help public health professionals and health care providers monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and support better understanding of U.S. illness, disease severity, and social disruptions associated with COVID-19.
These data help inform the U.S. national public health response to COVID-19.
CDC U.S. COVID-19 case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths.
This change was made to reflect an interim COVID-19 position statement pdf icon10 Pages, 251 KBexternal icon issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020.
The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease.
A probable case or death is defined by
Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase.
(Sometimes this effect is described as backfill.)
State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC.
Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.
The growing number of cases reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread.
Also, the number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country.
More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
CDC updates information on laboratory testing from multiple sources.
This includes testing results from state, local and territorial public health departments, CDC and commercial laboratories.
The COVID-19 death count shown on the Cases in the U.S. web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments.
This count reflects the most real-time information CDC has based on preliminary reporting from health departments.
In contrast, provisional COVID-19 death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday-Friday based on information collected from death certificates.
These data represent the most accurate death counts.
However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, these data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods.
Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received.
Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from other published sources, such as media reports or the Cases in the U.S. web page.
The mortality rate is the percentage of people who died out of the total number of cases reported.
Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage might change daily.
There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases and not all cases will be detected.
CDCs overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions.
The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
Yes, CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19.
On April 3 we posted the first of what will be a weekly surveillance report called, COVIDView.
The report, updated each Friday, will summarize and interpret key indicators, including information related to COVID-19 outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths, as well as laboratory data.
As part of our weekly reporting, CDC has data on hospitalization rates and demographics as part of its COVID-NET surveillance system.
COVID-19 surveillance data is also used to produce publications.
Many of these reports can be found online through CDCs  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) .
COVID-19 data are also used to inform guidance documents.
CDC Coronavirus Interactive is a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily.
The website builds on other agency efforts – such as CDCs new weekly COVID-19 Surveillance report, COVIDView – to capture the impact the virus is having on the United States.
CDC Coronavirus Interactive presents data using visual dashboards that include interactive maps, graphs and other visuals.
It is being developed in phases.
The first phase showcases data on U.S. cases and deaths of COVID-19 and social impacts of COVID-19 disease.
CDC Coronavirus Interactive is updated daily.
Specifics of data reporting are described as a footnote on each page.
Upon its launch on April 17, 2020, CDC Coronavirus Interactive users will be able to track the following data daily: U.S. cases and deaths of COVID-19 and social impacts of COVID-19 disease.
CDC Coronavirus Interactive displays these data using visual dashboards that include interactive maps, charts and other visuals.
The data and information provided by Coronavirus Interactive will be expanded over time.
The following data and information are currently planned for inclusion in Coronavirus Interactive in future phases:
